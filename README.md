# AutoLog
Aren't you afraid of being hacked while using the same password to every website?
Do you think memorizing different passwords are hard?

AutoLog is here to help you!

## How can I install it?
Firstly you have to install all the components by installing autolog.sci-soft.eu/AutoLog_install.exe and running it!
To start you have to run AutoLog_manage.exe which will command you through typing in your information then you make a shortcut and set the shortcut key to it which you paste in to \AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs.
After these it is ready to use on any website by pressing the shortcut key which you have defined!

## How does it work?
It saves all your log in information to a file BUT they are encrypted so if anyone opens it they won't know your information.
The key for decryption is hidden in image.png so only the software will really know your log in information to paste them whenever you need on any website.

It copies the url of your current working website then loops through your information and if there is a match it is ready to type in your credentials.
Click into the username/email entry then into the password entry.
After pasting the username and password it presses enter so you only have to click twice to log in to a website.

ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS!
